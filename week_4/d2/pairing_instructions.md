## Driver and Navigator Pairing

We will be following strict pairing over the next few classes!
One portion of App Academy's technical screen will have you pair with your interviewer
to work with a problem. This pair work will be App Academy style, with a designated
**driver** and **navigator** at any given point.

Let's work through today's problem set with your partner. Be sure to communicate throughout.
Remember that coding a solution is only half of the battle of a bootcamp interview.
Communicating and collaborating over a solution is the other half! Take this
practice seriously. App Academy is looking for candidates who will thrive during the
collaborative curriculum.

Before coding any of these problems, be methodical and follow the steps in this doc.

### Driver and Navigator

During this pair work, there will be a **driver** and a **navigator**:

- **Navigator** will make decisions on solving the problem. They get to decide the
direction you will take on solving the problem. Formulate ideas and make suggestions!
- **Driver** will use the keyboard/mouse. They are tasked with typing up the code,
translating the navigator's plan into some JavaScript syntax. Only the driver should
be touching the keyboard!

There should be a constant back and forth conversation between the driver and navigator
throughout. Although we have these roles exist, discuss everything and make sure you are both
on the same page every step of the way. It is absolutely normal and okay to disagree
on where to steer your solution. Take this opportunity to start a dialogue and learn
from each other's insights!

### Stay on the Same Page

**Be proactive in both asking for help and offering it.**
If you are finding a piece of code or concept confusing, make it a point to ask
your partner to slow down and ease your understanding. On the flip side of that,
if you are not convinced that your partner is 100% grasping things like you, offer
clarification. If questions still persist, call over a TA for a hand.

**Be patient with both yourself and your partner.**
As you work in pairs, it is very important to stay respectful and positive. Listen
to your partner and be receptive to what they have to say. When learning new concepts
and solving unfamiliar problems, it is normal to struggle. In most pairing scenarios,
one student may have a stronger grasp of the material. This is normal.
- *If you sense that you have a weaker understanding than your partner, don't be discouraged
that you are trailing behind them or holding them back.* Be grateful that you have
this opportunity to learn from them and use their knowledge to fill gaps in your own.
This is your education! If you have a weaker understanding entering the pair,
then you have more to gain.
- *If you sense that you have a stronger understanding, be empathetic for your partner.*
Do not leave them behind. Being able to teach a concept to someone else shows mastery
of the material. When teaching someone else, you will realize that this will
test your own understanding. Do you understand a concept deeply enough so you can
simplify it to it's essence so that someone else can comprehend? Feel free to
take a break from the problem to go over a simple repl example to iron out any
of confusion. Furthering someone else's knowledge is also extremely rewarding.
Trust us.

### Use Only a Single Computer

To really get into the spirit of collaborating, you and your partner will be writing
code using a single computer (rock-paper-scissors for whose to use?).
You and your partner will take turns being driver or navigator, switching every 6 minutes.
Only 1 person should be using the keyboard at a time. Use this [timer][timer] and set it to 6
minutes (turn on your volume)! Whenever you switch, be sure to reset the timer.

### Before Coding a Solution

- Have the [stopwatch][timer] open in a tab and set it for 6 minutes.
  - Don't start the timer until you begin coding!
- Make sure you both understand what the question is asking.
- Make sure you both understand the examples. Are there any details to consider
in the examples?
- Formulate and discuss a plan. Think about what tools you will use: iterate through
an array, declare a count variable, define a helper function, etc..
- You don't need a super detailed plan to begin coding, just the big picture.
Be ready to adapt, you may want to change your plan as you are code.

### While Coding a Solution

- Start the timer minutes.
- Only the driver should be typing, but both of you should discuss
- Pair work should be an open conversation, speak up, throw around ideas!
- Before moving on from a piece of code, make sure you are both on the same page.
- If you both are stuck and need hints or help debugging, call over a TA for a nudge!
- Pause the timer when receiving help from a TA
- Don't be afraid to peek at the solutions if you are stumped or want a hint.
If you look at the solution, be sure to step through how it works in your pair
and then code it up!

### After Coding a Solution

- Pause the timer. Before moving on to the next problem, you and your partner should take turns
explaining the solution you both came up with.
- Be sure to look at our github solution and discuss it if you see any differences from
your own.
