## Pairing

Work through today's problem set with your partner. Be sure to communicate throughout.
Remember that coding a solution is only half of the battle of a bootcamp interview.
Communicating and collaborating over a solution is the other half!

Before coding any of these problems, be methodical and take these steps.

### Use Only a Single Computer

To really get into the spirit of collaborating, you and your partner will be writing
code using a single computer (rock-paper-scissors for whose to use?). You and your partner will take turns typing on
the computer, switching every 6 minutes. Only 1 person should be using the keyboard at a time.
Use this [timer][timer] and set it to 6 minutes!

### Before Coding a Solution

- Don't start the timer until you begin coding!
- Make sure you both understand what the question is asking.
- Make sure you both understand the examples. Are there any details to consider
in the examples?
- Formulate and discuss a plan. Think about what tools you will use: iterate through
an array, declare a count variable, define a helper function, etc..
- You don't need a super detailed plan to begin coding, just the big picture.
Be ready to adapt, you may want to change your plan as you are code.

### While Coding a Solution

- Start the timer for 6 minutes.
- Only the designated typer should be typing, but both of you should discuss
- Pair work should be an open conversation, speak up, throw around ideas!
- Before moving on from a piece of code, make sure you are both on the same page.
Don't move on if your partner does not understand a step. Take this opportunity
to explain to them.
- If you need hints or help debugging, call over an instructor for a nudge!
- Don't be afraid to peek at the solutions if you are stumped. If you look at the
solution, be sure to step through how it works in your pair.

### After Coding a Solution

- Before moving on to the next problem, you and your pair should take turns
explaining the solution you both came up with!
