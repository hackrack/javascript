## Non-Technical Practice Conversation

Time to practice having a non-technical conversation about your background!
With a partner you'll take turns asking and responding to common bootcamp
fit interview questions. Don't worry if you feel unprepared or on the spot right now.
Before you take your real non-technical interview, you'll have time to plan your
answers to the common questions. Now's your chance to see how you react to
natural conversation, with little preparation. You can never anticipate which
direction a conversation will go.

### Instructions

With your assigned pair, take turns playing interviewer and candidate with the below questions!
One person should be the interviewer, asking all 6 questions to the candidate. The interviewer can ask the questions
in any order, but always start with the first one (the dreaded *"Tell me about yourself"*). You'll notice
that each question has two parts *Initial* and *Follow-Up* portion. Ask the *Initial* first. Ask the *Follow-Up* after the
candidate responds to the initial question.

**Switch roles only after all 6 questions have been given.**

### Questions
