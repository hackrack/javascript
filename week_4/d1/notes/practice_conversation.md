## Non-Technical Practice Conversation

Time to practice having a non-technical conversation about your background!
With a partner you'll take turns asking and responding to common bootcamp
fit interview questions. Don't worry if you feel unprepared or on the spot right now.
Before you take your real non-technical interview, you'll have time to plan your
answers to the common questions. Now's your chance to see how you react to
natural conversation, with little preparation. You can never anticipate which
direction a conversation will go.

### Instructions

With your assigned pair, take turns playing interviewer and candidate with the below questions!
One person should be the interviewer, asking all 6 questions to the candidate. The interviewer can ask the questions
in any order, but always start with the first one (the dreaded *"Tell me about yourself"*). You'll notice
that each question has two parts *Initial* and *Follow-Up* portion. Ask the *Initial* first. Ask the *Follow-Up* after the
candidate responds to the initial question.

**Switch roles only after all 6 questions have been given.**

### Questions

* **(Ask this first)** Tell me about yourself. What have you been up to in the last 2 years and what brought you to
the coding bootcamp scene?

* *Initial:* There are many great coding bootcamps out there. Why are you interested in App Academy in particular?
  
  *Follow-Up:* Why do you think you will succeed at App Academy?

* *Initial:* Pair programming is a key aspect of App Academy's curriculum. What qualities do you think
make a good partner?
  
  *Follow-Up:* Say you were paired up with an obviously shy/unresponsive partner, how would you get them to open up?

* *Initial:* App Academy requires a lot of stamina with a 100 hour per week commitment for 12+ weeks until you find a job.
Have you been in an environment like this before?
  
  *Follow-Up:* How would you stay motivated during the course?

* *Initial:* You've been programming quite a bit in Bootcamp Prep, what do you like about programming?
  
  *Follow-Up:* What's your least favorite aspect of programming?

* *Initial:* Creating an inclusive environment is important to App Academy. What do diversity and inclusion mean to you?
  
  *Follow-Up:* Many tech companies, not just bootcamps are focusing on diversity. Why do you think they value it?
