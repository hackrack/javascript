## What's Next

Congrats on making it through Bootcamp Prep! You've worked really hard over the
past month, but this is only the beginning of your programming careers! The next
step is your bootcamp interviews.

### Post-Course Studying

Wait! Just because we have reached the end of our 4 weeks does not mean you should
immediately schedule all of your bootcamp interviews. Before you start scheduling
interviews for your top bootcamp choices, ask yourself if you *feel* confident in
your abilities. Treat your application as your one shot to gain acceptance into
bootcamp. We recommend you take some time to go back through our curriculum and
redo all of the problems from the problem sets and assessments.

A good way to check if you are ready is to redo all the problems in the course,
but make it harder for yourself this time around. Use the following steps:

**Time yourself.** Give yourself a maximum of 15 minutes to work on any problem.
You will probably complete the easier problems in the course well below this time.

**Write the code without running it until the very end.** Only run the code when
the time is up. This will test your ability to understand how code will evaluate
and foresee any bugs or errors. On some bootcamp interviews, like App Academy,
you will not be allowed to check your code by running it.

**Explain your code.** After coming up with a solution to a problem, try explaining
your solution aloud. Remember that a huge part of a bootcamp interview is explaining
your thoughts!

### When you're feeling ready...

If you're feeling good, then give yourself a pat on the back. You've worked really hard and have learned a lot. Give yourself credit for that! Then take a look at the list below.

A good strategy is to apply to *every* bootcamp in the city(s) you are considering.
Even if you are dead-set on attending one particular coding bootcamp, going through multiple application processes will make for invaluable practice. Each application will force you to practice problem solving using programming, write code in a high-stress and timed environment, talk about your solution and sell yourself as an applicant. Start by applying to bootcamps that you don't care about or with less challenging application processes, and move your way up. Take every coding challenge and technical interview you receive seriously--remember, it's *invaluable practice*. Schedule technical interviews with bootcamps that you care about only when you truly feel ready.

### Scheduling a Mock Interview

For extra practice, we offer up to *two* mock interviews for each graduate. If you
are interested, please schedule yours [mock interviews here][mock-interviews].
You should take advantage of these!

### Applying to App Academy

- **If you have not applied to a/A before:**

[Apply][app_academy_app] normally and then App Academy will send you an email with a link to prep work and a link to schedule your technical interview. When applying, please use the same email you used to enroll in Bootcamp Prep.

- **If you have applied to a/A already:**

App Academy will send you an email after you've completed the course with a link to prep work and a link to schedule your technical interview.

In either case, you will have an expedited process, skipping the initial coding
challenges.

Best of luck on your interviews prep graduate. Remember your training!
