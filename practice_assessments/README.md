### Practice Assessments

This folder contains a practice assessment that corresponds to every "real"
assessment that you will take in class. For example `practice_1` will test
similar concepts and problems to that of `assessment_1` you will take during w1d5 class.

Study these! But don't memorize solutions, *understand* them. If you are able to
work through these practice assessments on your own with no extra resources, then
you'll be in great shape for the actual assessments. Give these an honest attempt
first, but feel free to take advantage of the solutions we have provided. The ultimate
test is to solve them on your own. After peeking at the solution, give the problems a
shot on your own to test your understanding.

**A rule of thumb to use as you study these practice assessments is to complete the
entire practice assessment four times over on your own**. Note that using notes or the
solutions we provide should not count toward a completion of the assessment. Use
notes and solutions to get to this level of understanding, but you *must* test yourself
in this way to ensure that you can be self sufficient as a programmer.

### Practice Schedule

We recommend that you don't work far ahead through the practice assessments. Focus on
only the practice that corresponds to the upcoming assessment. Here is a schedule you can
use. For example, before w1d5 you should have studied `practice_0` and `practice_1`.

Take before w1d5: [practice_0][p0], [practice_1][p1]

Take before w2d1: [practice_2][p2]

Take before w2d5: [practice_3][p3]

Take before w3d1: [practice_4][p4]

Take before w3d5: [practice_5][p5]

Take before w4d1: [practice_6][p6]

Take before w4d5: [practice_7][p7]

[p0]: ./practice_0
[p1]: ./practice_1
[p2]: ./practice_2
[p3]: ./practice_3
[p4]: ./practice_4
[p5]: ./practice_5
[p6]: ./practice_6
[p7]: ./practice_7
