### Scheduling a Mock Interview

For extra practice, we offer up to *two* mock interviews for each graduate. If you
are interested, please schedule your [mock interviews here][mock-interviews]. We
recommend you schedule these mock interviews no earlier than week 4, as it will
cover advance material. You should take advantage of these!

The mock interviews will be structured in the same way a real App Academy interview will be.
Your mock-interviewer will be someone from our team who also conducts actual technical
interviews. Treat this like a real interview, that way you get real experience and feedback.
Be aware that you will have to book in advance, so peek at the calendar and plan accordingly.
