## Assessment Instructions

Assessments are just practice, so don't stress out! Feel free to ask your instructors for hints and help as you code. You can ask for a big hint or a small hint to nudge in the right direction. We understand that there is some sport in working through problems on your own. So if you want, you can take the assessment solo. If you will be distracted from overhearing the chatter from instructors helping other students, feel free to put on some headphones.

Assessments will be made available in your class's [slack][bp-slack] channel by your instructor. Assessments are in class 8:00 - 9:00pm on Fridays and 6:30 - 7:30pm on Mondays. Here are instructions to set up and take an assessment.

### During an assessment
+ Download the assessment from slack and unzip it to somewhere you can access easily, like your Desktop.
+ Do not move or rename any of the files or folders inside.
+ Rename the outer assessment folder to `firstName_lastName_num` using your name and the assessment number.
  + For example, I would name my first assessment `alvin_zablan_1`.
+ Open the renamed assessment folder in Atom. Your job is to fill in the functions in the `problems` subfolder. Only modify the .js files in the `problems` folder.
+ Use your command line to `cd` into your assessment folder. You can then use the `mocha` command to test your assessment for correctness. Feel free to run `mocha` as frequently as you like.

Compress/zip your entire assessment folder (by right clicking)
+ Direct message your instructor the assessment by attaching a file by clicking the + in the slack text box.
