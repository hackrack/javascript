## What to Expect

Welcome to App Academy Bootcamp Prep! The goal of this course is to equip you
with strong programming fundamentals in JavaScript and prepare you to be a top
candidate for coding bootcamps. This course will not be easy. Do not expect to
devote only the 2 hours during class time and become a top candidate. Devote as
much time as possible inside and outside of class to grow as a programmer.
If your dream bootcamp is especially selective, remember that you want to stand out
against the crowd as a strong candidate. Leave nothing to chance. Prep hard so your
interviews are easy!

### Dealing with Beginner's Stress

As you begin to learn how to program, you will find how unforgiving it can be,
especially for a beginner. A single overlooked detail will lead to an entirely
wrong result. There will be times when you feel hopelessly lost. Don't get
frustrated; don't give up. Programmers at every level experience this feeling.
Like learning any skill, we improve with practice and repetition.

**Week 1** may feel especially tough. There is a steep initial learning curve in
programming due to getting used to syntax and language rules. This is a typical
feeling, stick with it and things will start to click the more time you spend
coding.

If you already have some coding background, you may find week 1 as review, but
fret not! Things pick up in the weeks after.

### Daily Schedule

A typical day will consist of lecture and problem set time. Length of lecture
ranges depending on the day's topic. Problem set time is where we turn it over to
you to work through some problems solo or in pairs. Problem set time is your
opportunity to ask questions as you work.

### Assessments

Assessments are Mondays and Fridays (except the first Monday). It is quite typical
to not do well on the Friday assessments (especially the first assessment). Don't
stress out about the assessments, they are only practice and can be used to measure
how comfortable you are with the material. We don't give any penalties or strikes for
doing poorly on Assessments. Just try your best and you can do no wrong! The most
important thing is to learn from your mistakes you make. Make as many mistakes
as you can now, learn from them, and crush your interviews when the time comes.
