## The Art of Programming

Programming is the process of developing a set of instructions that automate performing
a specific task or solving a specified problem. The instructions are written in a
programming language and executed by a computer.

## The Language of Programming

A programming language is a formal, constructed language designed to communicate
instructions to a computer. When describing a programming language, we can think
about it in two ways: syntactically and semantically. The *syntax* of a language
refers to how its symbols are structured into valid statements and expressions.
The *semantics* of a language refers to the meaning of those symbols. When learning a new
language, one of the first steps is to get an understanding of its syntax and semantics.

In this course, we will be using JavaScript, and the first couple of days will be dedicated to
learning its syntax and semantics.

## The Skill of Programming

In order to be a great software engineer, there are certain tangential skills that
must be cultivated:

1. Logical Reasoning
2. Numerical Reasoning
3. Procedural Reasoning
4. Curiosity
5. Debugging

One of the primary goals of the course is to provide you with the foundation and
resources to develop these skills.

## The Complexity of Programming

```
The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity, of mastering multitude
and avoiding its bastard chaos as effectively as possible.

    -Edsger Dijkstra
```

Once you start implementing programs of a sufficient complexity, you will find that
it is *very* easy to make mistakes. Unlike computers, the human brain does not always
think in perfect logic or arithmetic. The software engineers of the past quickly
realized this and started developing techniques and structures to manage the complexity
of their programs: variables, good style, abstraction and decomposition, objects
and classes. Don't worry if some of those words seem unfamiliar. We will explore
them all and more in the course.

## The Secret to Programming

There is no secret. Like any skill, the key to becoming a great programmer is time
and practice. Practice as much as you can and you will feel your confidence grow.
Programmers seldom solve problems easily in a sudden flash of genius
(as portrayed on television)! Programmers solve problems by being meticulous and measured. Be patient with yourself as you learn!
