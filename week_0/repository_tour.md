## GitHub Repository

https://github.com/appacademy/Bootcamp-Prep-Curriculum

During Bootcamp Prep we will be using our GitHub repository to access all of our
curriculum resources. Here are the parts of the repository you may use daily!

### Daily Folders

We have the curriculum resources organized by week-day. For example the notes and  
resources for the first day of class are in `w1/d1`. Inside a typical day you will
find notes and problem set. It would be best to read through the days notes before class,
that way you can come in with any questions that you may have.

### Solutions

Solution code is available in the solutions folder for each day. As you work through
problems, don't be afraid to peek at the solutions when you get stuck! The most
important thing to do is to understand every line of code in the solutions so you
apply this knowledge in new problems. Use the solutions to study, but be sure that
you are able to solve the problems

Even if you are able to work through a problem on your own, be sure to look at our
solution nonetheless. There may be a different take on the problem that interests you!
There are many ways to solve a given problem.
