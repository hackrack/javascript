## Bootcamp Prep Online

 As students of the Bootcamp Prep Live course, you have also been giving access
 to the Online course. Feel free to use the **video lectures and video solutions** to
 complement the in person lectures from class. You can search the Bootcamp Prep Online
 content by topic or problem name. This is particularly helpful when you
 miss a class or need to reinforce some topics or problems. This is the same content
 in the live GitHub repository, except with video resources

 **You may use all the resources in Bootcamp Prep Online, except you should not
 download and view the assessments.** We will be taking those assessments at certain
 points of the class, so you should not spoil the content in these assessments. It
 is important to get as much experience programming in high pressure environments
 like assessments and interviews.
