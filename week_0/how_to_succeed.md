## How to Succeed

We've been teaching this class for a while now. Here are a few pro-tips used by
our most successful students.

### Treat the Course like a Bootcamp

Students who think that they can put in anything less than 100% will not reap the
full benefit of the course. It's also a very short course, only a month long. So for
this month, maybe you don't go out on the weekends. Study instead. Maybe you wake
up an hour early each day to get some coding in or go to bed an hour later. Every
time you are watching TV or surfing the net, you could be learning, growing, and
deepening your knowledge as a programmer. This discipline is necessary for your
success, and definitely needed to get to and through a rigorous bootcamp like App
Academy.

So treat this prep program as you would the Bootcamp that you dream of going to.
It'll be demanding, but if you give it 100%, you will be astounded by your growth.

## Be Patient with Yourself

You will not master programming in a week. You will make the same mistakes over
and over again. It is ok. Don't beat yourself up, don't use it as an excuse to
quit. Keep pushing. For example, when you realize that you are making the same
mistake over and over again, use that realization as fuel so you never make that
mistake again. Repeat as needed. You will soon find, almost subconsciously, you
will stop making the mistake. But you must be rigorous in understanding **why** you
made the mistake you made and **how** to fix it.

Focus on yourself, don't be discouraged if others around you seem to pick up the
material easier. It may take you hours to solve something that someone else solves
in a few minutes. Be ready for that challenge. The problems that are hard for
**you** are the problems worth studying.

A poor goal is to study problem x for half an hour. A good goal is to study problem
x until you understand it. You will not become a master programmer overnight.
Everything that is worth it in life takes time. Give yourself to time to grow into
the developer you want to become.

## Fight Your Fear; Ask Questions

Sometimes students may not ask questions because they are afraid of looking dumb.
Don't be afraid of looking unknowledgeable in front of others. By asking questions
you are taking steps to *becoming* knowledgeable. This is your education and your
money. Be selfish with your education. Ask for clarification if you need it.

## Be Methodical

As you work through the problem sets, ensure that you are able to code a solution
before moving on. Don't be afraid to use our solutions when you get stuck. The
most important thing is to understand **why** we wrote the code, so put that
knowledge to use next time. Test yourself before you "finish" studying a problem.
You should be able to code a solution all by yourself, without extra help.

Hold yourself to a high standard. Your worst regret on a technical interview
will be if you are given a problem you have seen before, but are unable to solve
it because you weren't honest with yourself when studying it the first time. Chances
are you won't be given the exact same problem you've seen before, but the key to
tackling these new problems is to use our previous knowledge.

## Program.

This one seems obvious, but it is a easy trap to fall into. To become a better
programmer, we must program. Don't fall into the trap of just reading notes and
watching videos. Your goal is to become self-sufficient when it comes to writing
code. You may find it easy to follow the lectures/videos/notes, but writing code
on your own is a different beast. Spend as much time as you can coding. Coding will
be difficult at first, but it gets easier with time and experience.
