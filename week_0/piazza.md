## Piazza

Piazza is a question/answer platform that we will be using during Bootcamp Prep.
We will also be using Piazza to do things like submit assessments and share the
code we build during lectures. Before the start of your Bootcamp Prep cohort,
you will be invited to the Piazza class.

### Asking Questions

The student's who get the most out of Bootcamp Prep are the ones who make it a
point to ask questions. Asking questions is vital when learning how to program as it is
how we fill gaps in our knowledge. There are a couple of ways to ask questions in
Bootcamp Prep. Raise your hand during lecture, ask for help during problem set time,
and postM on Piazza.

Piazza great for a couple of reasons. Students from both SF and NY will be in
a single class, which means we'll have more questions and answers. If you have a question
or thought, you should post to Piazza that way the entire class can benefit. When
asking a question on Piazza, you can supply code snippets to illustrate your question.
You may also ask anonymously or post a question that only instructors can see.

### Answer Questions

Another huge reason Piazza is awesome is that both instructors and students can respond
to questions. If you have insight into someone else's question, feel free to jump
in and post a response. The ability to discuss code is a skill
that will be tested on your technical interviews, so it is important to get practice
with this. Instructors will be monitoring the responses, so don't be afraid of
misleading others. Being able to explain a concept to someone else on a fundamental
level shows deep understanding!
