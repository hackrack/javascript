## Installing

There are a few programs we will be using heavily in Bootcamp Prep. Be sure to
install these before the first class, especially Atom and Node.

### Node.js

[Node.js][node] is a JavaScript runtime environment. It is what we will use to *run* our
JavaScript code.

+ Install Node from the official website, [here][node]
+ To check if you have installed it Node correctly, launch your command line interface
(Terminal on Mac, Command Prompt on Windows), type in `node -v` and hit enter. If
you see a version number, you are ready to rock.

Download the current stable version for your operating system. The installation is
very user-friendly. If you run into any problems, email us describing it the issue and
plan on coming in about 15 minutes early on the first day.

### Atom

[Atom][atom] is a text editor. It is what we will use to *write* our JavaScript code.

+ Install Atom from the official website. [here][atom]
+ Atom is a normal application you can open on your computer


### Mocha

[Mocha][mocha] is a testing framework. It is what we will use to test our code on assessments
and projects. We will begin using Mocha later in `week_1`. But feel free to install
it now.

#### Installing Mocha on Mac
  + Open Terminal
  + Enter this command: `sudo npm install -g mocha`
  + Enter your mac user password. The text you type may not show for security reasons, but type your password and hit enter anyways
  + To test your installation, run the command: `mocha --version`. If it returns
  a version number, you've successfully installed mocha otherwise, let your instructor know.

#### Installing Mocha on PC
  + Open Command Prompt
  + Enter this command: `npm install -g mocha`
  + To test your installation, run the command: `mocha --version`. If it returns
  a version number, you've successfully installed mocha!
