## Slack

[Slack][bp-slack] is a live team messaging app used all around the tech industry.
Slack is useful for chatting with your classmates and instructors in real time.
It's a great place to have a back and forth discussion about code. We will also be
making announcements occasionally. You should have received an invite to our slack
team upon enrolling. Feel free to jump into the `#general` channel now and say hello.
We highly recommend you download the [Slack][slack] application on your computer and
mobile device!

### Asking Questions

The student's who get the most out of Bootcamp Prep are the ones who make it a
point to ask questions. Asking questions is vital when learning how to program as it is
how we fill gaps in our knowledge. There are a couple of ways to ask questions in
Bootcamp Prep. Raise your hand during lecture, ask for help during problem set time,
and post on slack.

Slack is great for a couple of reasons. Students from both SF and NY will be in
a single class, which means we'll have more questions and answers. If you have a question
or thought, you should post to Slack that way the entire class can benefit. When
asking a question on slack, you can supply code snippets to illustrate your question.

### Answer Questions

Another huge reason Slack is awesome is that both instructors and students can respond
to questions. If you have insight into someone else's question, feel free to jump
in and post a response. The ability to discuss code is a skill
that will be tested on your technical interviews, so it is important to get practice
with this. Instructors will be monitoring the responses, so don't be afraid of
misleading others. Being able to explain a concept to someone else on a fundamental
level shows deep understanding!
